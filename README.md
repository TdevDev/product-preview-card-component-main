## Overview

For this project, I built a responsive card for perfume.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

Step 1: Look at the design as a whole
Step 2: Add HTML and classes based on the design
Step 3: Add Josh Comeau's CSS reset to style.css
Step 4: Add CSS variables to style.css (colors, typography, font-weights)
Step 5: Style the card

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My initial approach to this design was using bootstrap 5. But the more I used bootstrap, the more I was confused. I find it quite easy to find bootstrap components, add them, and manipulate them to fit my styles. The problems with bootstrap for me is that, it becomes very difficult for me to read and organize as I just see a huge div soup. With this initial approach, I was able to code around 60% of the project. I then started looking for solutions on the web to this project. I came across Kevin Powell's solution. I decided to code it along with him. I know this might not be the true way to go about the challenge, but I believe it was very necessary.

It is true that there are still many things that I don't quite fully grasp, but his process got me thinking in a very professional and organized manner. I am very grateful for Kevin Powell's concise and informative teachings.

I plan on recreating the card for some other concepts in order to hammer down the techniques that this project is responsible for. After all, learning the concepts requires being able to do it more than once for different scenarios.

1. how to properly organize my CSS
2. hidden property
3. how to name my CSS classes
4. how to deploy to github directly from VScode
5. how to deploy a live version directly to netlify from github

### Continued development

Items to be futher practiced:

1. css variables
2. css class organization

### Useful resources

I recommend pausing and understanding. Then recreating it on your own with different styles.
